We are monitoring various threats and in that context we have collected quite some dataabout the Trickbot botnet in the past few years. This paper is based on an analysis of selectedaspects of our Trickbot data collection. Some of our analysis is rather straightforward, yet,we also take the freedom to make some speculative statements, which might turn out to be debatable or plain wrong. In that spirit we are open for discussions and are happy to receive comments by the readers of this paper.
