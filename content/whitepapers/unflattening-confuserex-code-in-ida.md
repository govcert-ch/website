  title: Unflattening ConfuserEx .NET Code in IDA 
---

In this paper, we're studying the [ConfuserEx](https://mkaring.github.io/ConfuserEx/) obfuscation mechanism of a Ginzo .NET sample. This class of obfuscator is known as *code flatteners*. We describe how it can dealt with it using a Python script within [*IDA Pro*](https://hex-rays.com/), a famous reverse-engineering tool.
