<p>In February 2015, Magento (a popular eCommerce software for webshops) released a security patch addressing a critical vulnerability in its product. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a special prepared HTTP request to any website running a vulnerable version of Magento in order to execute malicious code on the remote webserver (a so called Remote Code Execution RCE vulnerability). More than two months later, MELANI / GovCERT.ch still sees a fairly big amount of websites in Switzerland running an old, vulnerable version of Magento, exposing themselves and its visitors to cyber-attacks from the internet. Hackers can (ab)use the vulnerability to e.g. place malicious code on the victims website to infect its visitors with malware (Drive-By exploits). MELANI / GovCERT.ch is currently aware of more than 1'100 websites hosted in Swiss IP address space or within Swiss name space (ccTLD .ch) which are still running a vulnerable version of Magento - some of them are popular webshops and well known in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Today, GovCERT.ch has sent out notifications to the responsible web hosting providers in Switzerland, informing them about websites hosted in their IP space running a vulnerable version of Magento and asking them to notify the associated website owners about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>We urge webmasters running Magento to ensure that they are using the latest version of Magento (SUPEE-5344). You can check if your website is vulnerable using the <em>Magento Shoplift Bug Tester</em>:</p>

</ul>

<p>Should you are using an older version of Magento, we highly recommend you to update to the latest version of Magento as <strong>soon as possible</strong>. The latest version of Magento can be found on the vendors website:</p>
