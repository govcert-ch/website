## About the data
The data is collected by citizens, organizations and spamtraps that report phishing attempts to NCSC/GovCERT, for example through antiphishing.ch. After validating the incoming messages, they are being dispatched to the major antiphishing organizations such as APWG (Anti Phishing Working Group), web browser vendors, blacklist providers as well as to the website owner and the assocaited hosting provider.

## Action recommended
We encourage everyone to report phishings via Report a Phish. And of course - never click on links in emails, especially in the case of HTML formatted eMail where the real link is not visible at first sight.
