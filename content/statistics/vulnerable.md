## About the data
These statistics originate from the VulnerableSystemsDB, a database containing systems in Switzerland that can be potentially abused for DDoS amplification and reflection attacks or are otherwise seriously vulnerable on the protocol level. It gives an overview of the most important protocols of the last 30 days and how the number of vulnerable systems evolved in the past 90 days.

## Action recommended
NCSC/GovCERT strongly recommends paying attention that no systems can be abused for DDoS reflection/amplification attacks. We regularly inform ISPs about vulnerable systems in their ASNs.
